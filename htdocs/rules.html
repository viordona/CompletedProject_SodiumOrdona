			<h1> Rules of the Game </h1>
			<p id = "indentation"> Brain Rush is a quiz competition where you have to correctly answer a series of <span id = "highlight"> multiple-choice questions </span> in order to advance to the next level/question. There are <span id = "highlight"> 15 questions </span> in total and each question is worth a specific amount of money, and a <span id = "highlight"> 25 second limit </span> decreasing by increments of 5 per level is placed for you to come up with an answer.  </p>
			<p id = "indentation"> The questions are structured according to <span id = "highlight"> 3 different levels </span> with each level increasing in difficulty. Each level contains <span id = "highlight"> 5 questions</span>. Questions that are grouped into the same level will all be of similar difficulty. For a fair game, you are <span id = "highlight"> not allowed </span> to switch tabs while playing. You will be given a warning if detected. Once you reach <span id = "highlight"> 5 warnings</span>, you will receive a <span id = "highlight"> game over</span>. </p>
			<p id = "indentation"> It is important to remember that the questions which make up each level will not necessarily relate to the same or even similar topics, but their overall level of difficulty will be the same. You will accumulate money with each correct answer, but if you answer incorrectly before reaching a <span id = "highlight"> safe haven</span>, you will stand to <span id = "highlight"> lose </span> a large amount of winnings. All scores and information will only be stored and displayed on the <a href = "leaderboard.html"> leaderboard</a></span> page when the game is finished. Below is a summary of the question value structure: </p>
